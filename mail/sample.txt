Hi

I hope youâ€™re having a wonderful day!

I am emailing you today to let you know we have received your application for a new product.

We're really looking forward to completing this application and getting you all setup.

Before we do, we need some information from you as the application is stuck.

Please can you follow the link below, enter your email address and confirm the authentication. We'll then ask you the question and we're done.

Any problems, please feel free to call 0700 000 000.

Thank you
